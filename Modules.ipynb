    "## A Module in Python\n",
    "A module is a Python file containing a set of predefined and operational functions, classes, and variables, which you can use as you wish in your code!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are working on a problem involving geometry, you might need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Square—defined by the length of its side\n",
    "    * Triangle—defined by the length of its three sides\n",
    "    * Circle—defined by its radius\n",
    "    * Etc.\n",
    "* variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Pi: constant necessary for calculating the area of a circle, equal to 3.1415...\n",
    "    * Phi: constant that represents the golden ratio, equal to 1.6180...\n",
    "* functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Area: takes as parameter a geometrical object (square, triangle, etc.) and calculates its area\n",

    "You can of course define all these things in your notebook, but that would only make it more cumbersome. The best is to store all this in an external Python file, which you will then import into your notebook: it's a module!"
